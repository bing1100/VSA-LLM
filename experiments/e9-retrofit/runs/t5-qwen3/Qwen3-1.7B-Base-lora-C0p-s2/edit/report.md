# E9 dimension 3 — zero-shot by ontology editing — C0p seed 2 (Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B-Base/lora)

Run `experiments/e9-retrofit/runs/t5-qwen3/Qwen3-1.7B-Base-lora-C0p-s2`, channel `none`, weights: **bf16 (as trained)**. No weight is updated: new words and edits change only the alias table and the composer's frame schedule.

## (a) New words

300 of 300 invented names link to their new entry ({'linked': 300}; spurious sub-word links inside the names: 0). Chance: property 0.200, entailment 0.500.

| source | property | property_new | property_category | entailment | paraphrase | statement_accuracy | statement_margin | statement_loss |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| own | 0.1848 | 0.1998 | 0.1233 | 0.4583 | 0.3649 | 0.2230 | -1.0452 | 4.3159 |

`property_new`: the resampled edges (the new combinations); `statement_*`: the loss test in held-out wordings (per-token log-probability; `statement_loss` = gold filler nats/token, lower is better).

## (b) Edited words

200 of 200 edited concepts link ({'heldout': 100, 'seen': 100}); 363 neighbour concepts. **This model has no composed rows: the edit cannot change it (after = before).**

ES/PS: share of edit / paraphrase prompts preferring the new filler over the old (ROME/MEMIT efficacy and generalization); EM/PM: mean change of `log p(new) − log p(old)` from before to after the edit (nats); NS: share of neighbourhood prompts still preferring their true filler over the edited concept's new one (specificity); control: the same edit to a different same-type filler; score: harmonic mean of ES, PS, NS.
